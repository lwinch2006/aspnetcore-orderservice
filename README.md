# OrderService

Thanks for taking the time to do this refactoring exercise!

## Instructions

This solution contains some classes used by an imaginary service to generate order receipts, and some unit tests to prove that everything works.

Pretend this code is part of a larger software system and you are now responsible for it.

The company has requested these following changes:
* different discount types and percentages
* receipt in json format

Refactor the code so that it can survive these changes.

### Tip
* Your code should trend towards being SOLID.
* You should be confident that it works. 
* You should be comfortable the next developer will easily understand how to work with it.
* We use [NUnit3](http://www.nunit.org) and [FakeItEasy](https://fakeiteasy.github.io/) at Waypoint. References have been added using NuGet.

Please note:
* There is no right or wrong solution(s) for this task. Show us what you can do and we will discuss your refactoring choices during the technical interview. 
* Our email system will reject any zip-files/archives that contain binary files, so please do not include any in the solution you send back to us. 

Good luck and, most importantly, have fun :)
